Moco [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MontysCoconut/moco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MontysCoconut/moco)
====

`moco` is a [Monty](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/monty/) to
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler built using
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [ANTLR4](http://www.antlr.org/) and
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/).

Please read the [language
specification](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/monty/?p=downloads) for
details on the `Monty` programming language.

Installing Dependencies
=======================

Linux (Ubuntu)
--------------

Install [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and a JRE 7.

    sudo apt-get install llvm
    sudo apt-get install default-jre

If you want to build `moco` yourself you'll need to install the following
dependencies and a JDK 7.

    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install maven
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk

You can also install Graphviz to generate class diagrams. This is optional.

    sudo apt-get install graphviz

Mac OS X
--------

> **Note:** Please make sure you have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and a JRE 7
installed.

Install [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) using homebrew:

    brew install llvm

If you want to build `moco` yourself you'll need to install the following
dependencies and a JDK 7.

    brew install git
    brew install maven

Please make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for `maven`.

    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)

You can also install Graphviz to generate class diagrams. This is optional.

    brew install graphviz

Windows
-------

To use [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) you'll need to download and install the
following executables. In addition you'll need to download and extract the
`llvm-3.4-tools-windows.7z` archive into the `bin\` directory of your LLVM
installation. To run the executable .jar file you'll also need a JRE 7.


- http://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=40784 (the **x86 and
  the x64** version)
- http://llvm.org/releases/3.4/LLVM-3.4-win32.exe
- https://github.com/CRogers/LLVM-Windows-Binaries/releases/download/v3.4/llvm-3.4-tools-windows.7z

If you want to build `moco` yourself you'll need to install the following
dependencies and a JDK 7. These examples use the
[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager.

    choco install maven
    choco install java.jdk
    choco install git.commandline

You can also install Graphviz to generate class diagrams. This is optional.

    choco install graphviz

Building
========

> **Note:** Instead of building your own version you can always get a
precompiled .jar file at the
[releases](https://github.com/MontysCoconut/moco/releases) page.

For building your own version based on the most recent commit clone the git
repository:

    git clone https://github.com/MontysCoconut/moco.git

After that you can change into the directory and build the executable
.jar file. Now you can find the executable jar in the `target/` directory.

    cd moco
    mvn package

If you want to generate the class documentation make sure to have
[graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) installed and run the following command.
After that you can find the generated HTML-files in the `target/site`
directory.

    mvn site

Usage
=====

To use `moco` you'll either need to compile your own version or fetch a
precompiled .jar file at the
[releases](https://github.com/MontysCoconut/moco/releases) page.

You can just pass `moco` a Monty-file and it will be compiled and executed.

    ➤ cat hello.monty
    print("Hello World!")
    ➤ java -jar moco-0.6.jar hello.monty
    Hello World!

Please see the help text for information about the command-line switches.
