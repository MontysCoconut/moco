// Testing: Printing of Whitespaces
//
// We don't want whitespace in the output to be trimmed or changed in any way.
// To that end we print a series of whitespace characters and test for them
// in order to verify that they haven't been modified. In addition to ordinary
// whitespace, we have inserted some whitespace characters via escape sequences
// to cater for newlines and tabs.
//
// Expected output: <whitespaces that resemble the whitespace printed in the program>

String str := " 			      		 "
print(str)
