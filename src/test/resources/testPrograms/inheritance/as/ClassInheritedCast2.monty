// Testing: ClassDeclaration with single inheritance and casting.
//
// The program must fail casting the expression as the expression was never an
// instance of B. The program fails before printing.
//
// Expected output:

class Ab:
    + initializer():
        pass

class Ba inherits Ab:
    + initializer():
        pass

    + methodB():
        print("Nope")

Ab a := Ab()
Ba b := a as Ba
b.methodB()
