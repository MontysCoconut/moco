// Testing: VariableDeclaration in ClassDeclaration with single inheritance.
//
// The char inherited attribute is written and printed from outside the
// class. The access via self and the member access must work.
//
// Expected output: M

    + initializer():
        self.attr := 'M'

class Ba inherits Ab:
    + initializer():

Ba b := Ba()
